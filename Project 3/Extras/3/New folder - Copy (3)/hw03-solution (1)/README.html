    <p> I used Eclipse for this project. I compiled it with 'run button on top left'.  The .java files are saved into 'src' folder, open npate305_hw4_cs342\ hw4 \ src Please click on Main.java if you are using Eclipse. It should open all the .java into eclipse. Run with 'run button on the top left'. To add vehicle type 'v' into command, System will pop up with 3 options type-in 1,2 or 3 according to the vehicle you are trying to add. It will ask you for 'make', 'model', 'year', (user input would be 'nissan' 'sentra' '2001') than system will give you 3 options type in '1', '2' or '3' according to your needs. Than system will ask you to enter 'id' number and  'cost' of the vehicle.  Now from here the option will change according to your previouse selected options, Let's say you have selected '1. Car' than the system will ask you to enter 'bodyType' (for example- sedan). If you have selected '2. Minivan' than system will ask you to enter length and width of the minivan one by one.  If you have selected '3. Truck' than the system will ask you to enter weight of the Truck.  Once you entered all the informations about vehicles you can use other commands to either change vehicle status or reset list or list all vehicles or list all available vehicles or quit the program.
